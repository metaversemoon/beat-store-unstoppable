Beat Store

# Description

Welcome to Beat Store
Beat Heat Store was created for you; the writer, the performer, the beat maker, the producer, the engineer, the record label, the publisher, the videographer, the artist and the CREATOR. Beat Heat was built for the person telling their story with music and to find like-minded people to experience it with. Music is the universal language that connects us across the globe. Music brings out our human emotions and music is the unified voice of the people.

An Ecosystem built to support the use and the growth of Music projects by enabling participants to actively get involved in the network via theoretical and interactive educational content provided by the active communities of established Music projects.
